*The metamountain is a metaphorical mountain in [[Chucho]]'s mind. It has magical properties, floating islands and larger-than-life objects. None of it is to be taken literally. In it, [[Chucho]] has access to some abilities he otherwise wouldn't. The metamoutain seeks to mimic [[Chucho]]'s emotional state.*
