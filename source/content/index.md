title: Chucho Design document
---
A short narrative experience about a goat too shy to confess his love. Experience Chucho's life as he builds the courage to speak his heart.

Inspired by games like [Gris](https://store.steampowered.com/app/683320/GRIS/) or [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), Chucho's emotional story is shown through gameplay as his metaphorical journey manifests in game as a large mountain to summit. 

The player constantly shifts between climbing the metaphorical mountain, and relieving key memories of quiet interaction. With the color palette distinguishing between the two.
