## Dialog
![[dialog-example.jpg]]

At times, (but mainly during [[Core Memories]]) [[Chucho]] will be asked to respond and dialog with the other characters. The dialog follows a classic gaming trope where you are given 3 options, and a time limit to answer - no answer / silence is ALSO an option. 

These options do not meaningfully change the course of the game, but they do change the course of a particular interaction (in the way of Firewatch.) It is here to pull the player in and give the illusion of choice.

**Most important** however: Sometimes, and especially early on, all options are silence. [[Chucho]] has troubles opening up and is generally incredibly shy. To mimic this sentiment, the player is shown multiple options but as he tries to select them, they all disappear under your cursor. You cannot speak.

As the game progresses this happens less and less, but the more bold answers will take longer to become available. With "I love you" only happening at the [[8.Resolution|resolution]].
## Walk
![[path-example.jpg]]

[[Chucho]] is one of those [Strand-type games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukqZ5VOoK5s&t=57s) where the walking path isn't so even and walking itself becomes a mechanic. Using IK the Ibex-like walking is shown as the player moves through uneven terrain, seemingly unbothered by steep surfaces. He can choose whether to walk through unsatisfying paths or better ones but there is no strict lose-condition in that regard, just more or less satisfaction.

To increase the satisfaction factor. In the [[Metamountain]] world some of the rocks and environment elements react to your steps. Lighting up as you touch them Ã -la Refunct:

## Jump
The jump is forgiving, full of Coyote-time and all the other friendly gimmicks. There is no double jump, no dashes, just a simple healthy jump that allows Chucho to bounce from rock to rock, edge to edge.
