## Checkpoints
As a platformer, the game uses checkpoints to help the player. These checkpoints are generous and take the shape of Cairns rebuilding themselves as you come near.
## Dialog
![[dialog-example.jpg]]

At times, (but mainly during [[Core Memories]]) [[Chucho]] will be asked to respond and dialog with the other characters. The dialog follows a classic gaming trope where you are given 3 options, and a time limit to answer - no answer / silence is ALSO an option. 

These options do not meaningfully change the course of the game, but they do change the course of a particular interaction (in the way of Firewatch.) It is here to pull the player in and give the illusion of choice.

**Most important** however: Sometimes, and especially early on, all options are silence. [[Chucho]] has troubles opening up and is generally incredibly shy. To mimic this sentiment, the player is shown multiple options but as he tries to select them, they all disappear under your cursor. You cannot speak.

As the game progresses this happens less and less, but the more bold answers will take longer to become available. With "I love you" only happening at the [[Resolution|resolution]].
## Walk
![[path-example.jpg|300]]

[[Chucho]] is one of those [Strand-type games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukqZ5VOoK5s&t=57s) where the walking path isn't so even and walking itself becomes a mechanic. Using IK the Ibex-like walking is shown as the player moves through uneven terrain, seemingly unbothered by steep surfaces. He can choose whether to walk through unsatisfying paths or better ones but there is no strict lose-condition in that regard, just more or less satisfaction.

To increase the satisfaction factor. In the [[Metamountain]] world some of the rocks and environment elements react to your steps - lighting up as you touch them.
## Jump
The jump is forgiving, full of Coyote-time and all the other friendly gimmicks. There is no double jump, no dashes, just a simple healthy jump that allows Chucho to bounce from rock to rock, edge to edge.
## Rope 
Early on, [[Chucho]] is given(?) a climbing rope. This rope isn't for "climbing" however, but it does allow him to overcome obstacles.
### Slackline
[[Chucho]] throws and attaches the rope between two anchors, he can then balance and walk over it.
### Hook
[[Chucho]] throws the rope at an anchor and pulls. This can lower bridges and break obstacles. In the [[Metamountain]], this can also pull entire platforms, or pull YOUR platform to another.
## Headbutt
### Handwave
**([[Metamountain]] only)**
This is the post-[[Second Challenge|second challenge]] equivalent to the headbutt. [[Chucho]] has lost one of his horns and cannot headbutt obstacles anymore. However he doesn't care, he has gone beyond anger straight to grief and now simply hand waves these same obstacles like they were nothing.
## Reorder 
**([[Metamountain]] only)**
During the [[Second Growth|second growth]], [[Chucho]] slowly gets a better hold over his emotion, and his destructive power now allow the opposite: he can bring back order to some of the chaotic areas.
