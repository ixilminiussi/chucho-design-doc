## Who ?
[[Chucho]], [[Poudre]], Diego
## Where ?
Bottom of the [vall√©e de l'Ubaye](https://www3.mercantour-parcnational.fr/fr/des-decouvertes/destination-parc-national-du-mercantour/les-vallees-du-parc/vallee-de-lubaye)
## What ?
As you place the edelweiss behind your back, we match cut to [[Chucho]] in different clothing, different place, waiting for [[Poudre]] to finally come back. We see the car in the distance approaching, the door opening, and [[Poudre]] finally stepping out, along with her new friend: Diego. All of this strength in [[Chucho]] disappears as he loses his mind:

	- [Scream]
	- [Scream]
	- [Scream]

All of these do nothing, and we simply zoom into [[Chucho]]'s face as we match cut right back to the [[Metamountain]] with a torrent of water swiping him off the top and ragdolling him all the way back down. Breaking one of his horns on the way down.
