There, she breaks the news to you. Her and her mother are moving away for a while. Chucho falls silent again, the options

	- Please stay
	- Wait, but I like you
	- [Go for a hug]

are all blank again. And a jump cut moves to when she is gone, your horns slightly larger now. Where she used to sit is a letter from her. The letter implies you were supposed to meet her here right before she'd left but you were too late, or she was too early. It simply says goodbye and promises to come back by next summer.
