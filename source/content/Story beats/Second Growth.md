[[Metamoutain]]
## What ?
After lying in a puddle for a bit, [[Chucho]] finally stands up. his walking is slower now, and the environment doesn't light up as he moves. He breaks open walls not by heabutting them, but by [[Mechanics#Handwave|Handwave]]. Slowly his walking speeds up and so do the platforming challenges. Gradually his steps light the environment again. The [[Metamountain]] sometimes seeps through and shows bits of [[Poudre]]'s history where we notice she'd lie about her interest, and had simply learned about it after learning [[Chucho]] enjoyed it. More and more we notice how she herself had feelings for [[Chucho]], we see her own dialog trees and the sentences she'd wished she'd said. Seeing those unlocks a new ability over time [[Mechanics#Reorder|Reorder]]. The player takes on tougher challenges until he arrives back up.
