## Who ?
[[Chucho]] and his mother
## Where?
Bottom of the [vall√©e de l'Ubaye](https://www3.mercantour-parcnational.fr/fr/des-decouvertes/destination-parc-national-du-mercantour/les-vallees-du-parc/vallee-de-lubaye)
## What?
The game starts you as a baby Ibex, distracted and awoken by your mum. She hurries you along and tells you to follow her on your way to a meeting spot. There, you will meet her old friend - also a newly-mother.

The way up is played as a tutorial as you learn your first [[mechanics]]:  [[Mechanics#Walk|Walk]], [[Mechanics#Jump|Jump]], [[Mechanics#Dialog|Dialog]]

The player follows his mum through increasingly (but at this point stake-less) terrain at the foot of a mountain, surrounded by nature. She tells him to hurry as they are meant to meet an old friend for picnic.
