## Who ?
[[Chucho]], [[Poudre]]
## Where ?
Their secret spot
## What ?
There, he sees, [[Poudre]] in a puddle of water as well, implying she too has been heart-broken. [[Chucho]] hands her the wet Edelweiss he had found and she hugs him. They both sit to the view they had seen before. After a brief pause, the player is given an option:

	- I love you
	- I'm sorry
	- ...

Whichever he chooses, [[Poudre]] also chooses and says at the same time, and then puts her head on his shoulder.
