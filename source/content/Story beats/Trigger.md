## Who ?
[[Chucho]], [[Poudre]], both their parents
## Where ?
In a glade, their picnic spot
## What ?
They arrive to the spot and meet [[Poudre]] and her mother. [[Chucho]]'s is instantly speechless as he struggles to speak to people he hasn't met before. The player is offered a few dialog options: 

	- Hi! I'm Chucho
	- Ayyyyy there...
	- Hello.

However every one of these disappears under the selecting cursor. Whichever the player picks, [[Chucho]] stays silent, mouth open. His mother laughs it off and [[Poudre]] introduces herself, giving the player another chance.

	- Sorry, I'm not sure what happened there! I'm Chucho!
	- Hi Poudre. Nice to meet you!
	- What is happening to me !?

Once again, complete silence, nothing comes through. His mother apologizes for him being shy, everyone understands, she suggests we start eating! [[Chucho]] is offered another choice

	- [Scream]
	- I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING!
	- Mum, can we go home ?

The last option IS available actually, altho it is whispered as he sheepishly asks his mother to go. She smiles and tells him everything is gonna be alright, and to go play with [[Poudre]] a little bit. She tells you about a cool spot to go check out and the entire world disappears. You are now in the [[Metamountain]] and things are very monotone, with the exception of a light somewhere up the mountain, where [[Chucho]] is meant to go.
