## Who ?
[[Chucho]], [[Poudre]], both their parents
## Where ?
In a glade, their picnic spot
## What ?
They arrive to the spot and meet [[Poudre]] and her mother. [[Chucho]]'s is instantly speechless as he struggles to speak to people he hasn't met before. The player is offered a few dialog options: 

	- Hi! I'm Chucho
	- Ayyyyy there...
	- Hello.

However every one of these disappears under the selecting cursor. Whichever the player picks, [[Chucho]] stays silent, mouth open. His mother laughs it off and [[Poudre]] introduces herself, giving the player another chance.

	- Sorry, I'm not sure what happened there! I'm Chucho!
	- Hi Poudre. Nice to meet you!
	- What is happening to me !?

Once again, complete silence, nothing comes through. His mother apologizes for him being shy, everyone understands, she suggests we start eating! [[Chucho]] is offered another choice

	- [Scream]
	- I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING!
	- Mum, can we go home ?
