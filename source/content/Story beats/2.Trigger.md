## Who ?
[[Chucho]], [[Poudre]], both their parents
## Where ?
In a glade, their picnic spot
## What ?
They arrive to the spot and meet [[Poudre]] and her mother. [[Chucho]]'s is instantly speechless as he struggles to speak to people he hasn't met before. The player is offered a few dialog options: 

	- Hi! I'm Chucho
	- Ayyyyy there...
	- Hello.

However every one of these disappears under the selecting cursor. Whichever the player picks, [[Chucho]] stays silent, mouth open.
