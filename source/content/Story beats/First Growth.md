## Who ?
[[Chucho]]
## Where ?
[Monte Argentera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Argentera)
## What ?
As you stand back up you are very much in the [[Metamountain]]. [[Chucho]] is determined to climb to the top. As you do, your path lights up and grows. You unlock a new ability: [[Mechanics#Headbutt|Headbutt]] which you use to knock down trees as bridge. The player is expected to use all his acquired skills so far and really shine as a player.
Eventually, another swipe transition shows [[Chucho]] almost fully grown, with both horns at their largest. He can now break open rocks and build confidence.

This entire time you alternate between climbing the [[Metamountain]] and climbing the [Monte Argentera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Argentera), tallest mountain in the Mercantour. Going up you regularly see massive calendars counting down to the day you will see her again. You reach the peak, a proud goat now, and pick an Edelweiss from the top. You pan to see the mercantour, match cutting between the real mountain and the [[Metamountain]], both virtually the same as you reached the peak of either.
