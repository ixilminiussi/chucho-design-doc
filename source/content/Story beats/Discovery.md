## Who ?
[[Chucho]], [[Poudre]]
## Where ?
Somewhere up the picnic spot, then in a secret spot.
## What ?
You climb the mountain up to that spot, lighting up rocks as you go. The terrain gets progressively steeper as you do. Once you get there you enter back into the memory space as [[Poudre]] shows you this cool spot which she has furnished a little bit, and you both turn to see the view. "what do you think of this? Beautiful right?"

	- Woaaaaah
	- I guess
	- You're so cool...

For the first time, the first 2 options are properly accessible and you may speak. You get to properly introduce yourself and bond slightly. [[Poudre]] asks what you like, and whatever you say, she happens to like to! (you later learn that to be a lie)

You make arrangements to meet again, and [[Poudre]] hands you a climbing [[Mechanics#Rope|Rope]]. She then disappears again as you reenter [[Metamoutain]] where you learn to use that climbing [[Mechanics#Rope|Rope]] through various challenges, pulling platforms and moving around using the [[Mechanics#Hook|Hook]] mechanic. 

In there, a foreground element does a simple wipe transition and you're now slightly older. You arrive at a new area (back to memory) where you meet her again, she too is older, and happens to be clumsily doing the thing she claimed to like. 

She is excited to show you a new spot. You quickly come upon a familiar gap and throw your [[Mechanics#Rope|Rope]] out to a [[Mechanics#Hook|Hook]] and pull, only for nothing to happen. [[Poudre]] laughs at you slightly, confused why you would try something like this in the real world (the player learns here that mechanics between both worlds are slightly different) and you are in fact expected to attach the [[Mechanics#Rope|Rope]] on both hands and use it as a [[Mechanics#Slackline|Slackline]]. After very few platforming you find a secret spot with a gorgeous view. The sun is setting slightly and you both seat by the edge.
